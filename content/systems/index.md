Along with the more typical application development and data science services, I also offer specialized services in the following areas:

- HPC (High Performance Computing)
- Alternative modeling methods:
  - Agent-Based Modeling
  - Discrete Systems Simulation

These tools are often used alongside the more common data science tools for handling complex problems (large-scale social science simulations, manufacturing optimization, etc.). When appropriate, these methods can provide insights and solutions that other methods cannot, so they are an essential, if less often used, part of my problem-solving toolkit.

Email me if you have questions about how these tools can be put to use for your problem or project.
