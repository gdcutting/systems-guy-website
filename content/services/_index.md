### Custom Programming and Data
I primarily work in Python, R, SQL but have worked in other languages as well. Every project is different so get in touch to talk about the details.

I enjoy model-building, data analysis, and machine learning projects. I have a master's degree in Systems Science with certificates in computational intelligence and simulation and modeling, and years of experience working with data and modeling complex systems, so I'm well-prepared to tackle even the toughest of problems and projects.
<!---See my [systems and data science website](https://guydcutting.com) and [GitHub page](https://github.com/gdcutting) for more details.--->

<br>
Have a need for something that combines a number of these pieces? Great! I enjoy taking on challenging projects with a lot of moving parts. I have years of experience with hardware, software, data (collection, analysis, and visualization), and the alchemy of putting these elements to good use.

Need help with something not listed here? [Feel free to ask](mailto:guy@systemscienceguy.com) - every situation is different, and I love working on new and interesting projects.
