My name is Guy Cutting, and I'm a resident of the beautiful city of Portland, Oregon. I have a master's degree in Systems Science from Portland State University.

I have been building and maintaining computers and websites for 20 years. I also have years of experience programming in Python, R, MySQL, C/C++, and other languages.

I'm a passionate jazz fan, and I enjoy helping people set up their digital and musical environments to make all their favorite media easily accessible, so there are no barriers to listening and watching.

I believe that technology should work for people, and not the other way around. I enjoy helping people get the most out of their digital tools.

See my [mission statement](/mission/) for more on why I'm passionate about helping people navigate the complex digital landscape.
