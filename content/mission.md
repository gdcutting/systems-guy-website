My mission is to be your friendly digital advisor. We live in a world overflowing with tools and technologies, but the profusion of technology is a double-edged sword. It can be difficult to make sense of the rapidly evolving digital and information environment.

The complexity of our systems demands specialization, but this creates a fragmented landscape in which the big picture is easily lost. The need often arises for a someone that can help you and your business make sense of all of this information, a general practitioner that can address a wide range of issues, and connect you with a specialist when one is needed.

I believe that technology should work for people, and not the other way around. Too often, we assume that a technical solution must be the best solution, and the real human concerns get pushed to the side. My goal is to provide friendly, accessible advice and services that take your real needs into account, and don't miss the forest for the trees.

Sometimes you have technology questions, but aren't quite sure where to turn. One company will build you a website, but they won't tune up your slow office computer or swap out a hard drive. Another company will provide professional IT services, but consider many important day-to-day issues too simple to bother with. A software developer might build you a great new tool, but neglect to tell you up front that there was an existing solution that already solved your problem.

My goal is to offer honest and comprehensive advice about how best make use of the many digital tools that are available, and to help you get your digital environment to a state of enjoyment and productivity. I like fixing, building, analyzing, coding, and new and interesting combinations of all of the above.

Relationships are more important than transactions. I aim to provide useful services that add value. But most importantly, I strive to be a reliable source of information and guidance, someone you can trust and who will always treat you with respect.

See the [services page](/services/) for more details on how I can help. If you have questions, feel free to [get in touch](/contact/). [Schedule](/appointments/) a phone or on-site appointment if you need more detailed advice.
