Our world is inundated with data, but making sense of it can be overwhelming. Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning have been the subject of a lot of hype and breathless salesmanship in recent years, but how can these things work for you and your business?

The benefits of these technologies can be huge, but the costs can also be significant. Though there has been a great deal of progress in the tools and techniques used for Data Science and AI/ML, deploying these technologies is often time-consuming and costly. I can help you make sense of how to put your data to use and the most effective way to deploy and maintain a solution.

I offer a wide range of services in the area of data science, from basic data cleaning and exploratory analysis, to more sophisticated modeling and visualization, to end-to-end application solutions deployed in the cloud.
